# Fintech Credit-Scoring Seminar  
Synthetic Data & Model Benchmarks

A minimal, reproducible pipeline that

* builds six synthetic datasets (scorable / unscorable, three generators),
* trains logistic-regression and random-forest baselines,
* outputs fidelity checks and ROC figures.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<user>/fintech-synthetic-credit.git
cd fintech-synthetic-credit
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# generate data
python notebooks/02a_synthetic_data_generation_scorable_population.py
python notebooks/02b_synthetic_data_generation_unscorable_population.py

# summarise + train
python notebooks/03_data_summarizer.py
python notebooks/08_balanced_modeling.py
````

Figures appear in `figures/`, results in `data/`.
